# salesforce
This repository contains pieces of code I have made while studying the salesforce platform

So far, we have:

MeuCEP:
A Lightning Component that, given a ZIPcode, fill in the address fields automatically.

OpenModalBox
A Lightning Component that expects a child component. It creates a button that, when clicked, open a modal box with a child component inside.
