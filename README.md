# salesforce
This repository contains pieces of code I have made while studying the salesforce platform

So far, we have:

MeuCEP:
A lightning component that, given a ZIPcode, fills in the address fields of a form automatically.

OpenModalBox:
A lightning component that, given that the user has clicked the component's internal button, it opens a modal box with a child component inside.
